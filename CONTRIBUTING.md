## 🔐 Security Considerations

When contributing, keep in mind:

1. **Never remove mainnet blocking** - This is a core security feature
2. **Validate all inputs** - Especially addresses and transaction data
3. **Handle private keys carefully** - Never log or expose them
4. **Use secure storage** - Encryption must remain strong
5. **Test thoroughly** - Security bugs can have serious consequences

### Security Review Checklist

- [ ] No mainnet chain IDs are accessible
- [ ] Private keys are not logged or exposed
- [ ] Encryption is properly implemented
- [ ] User input is validated
- [ ] No external dependencies with known vulnerabilities
